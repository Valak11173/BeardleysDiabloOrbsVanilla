Installation:

Just Copy the Folder to your Addons Folder in WoW Directory
Open the Graphics Option and enable UI-Scaling and set the Scale to 1 (pull the slider to the right side)

Settings:

Soon there will be a few console commands to configure the UI.
At this time, without console commands, you could change the interface size by change in the .lua file under settings the variable what sets the whole UI size to your desired value.

Hints:
 - Missing an actionbar? Enable all actionbars in the Interface Settings (ESC -> Interface)
 
 - UI too Big/Small? Change the scaling open "BeardleysDiabloOrbsVanilla.lua" and change the first Variable "scaleFactor"

 - When the artwork is not attached to the orbs just enable UI-Scaling in Graphics Options and set it to 1
 
 - Still miss an actionbar or button?  Just tell me which it was and I will add it ðŸ™‚
